# Dynamic Models Library

This repository provides a collection of mathematical and data-driven models for dynamic systems, including:
- Drone modeling (physics-based, neural state-space, system identification)
- Motor dynamics and control
- Battery modeling and management

## Structure
- `include/`: Header files for different subsystems (drone, motor, battery, utilities).
- `src/`: Implementation files for subsystems.
- `data/`: Example datasets for training or testing models.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for each subsystem.
- `examples/`: Example applications demonstrating model usage.

## Building
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/antshiv/dynamic_models.git
   cd dynamic_models
